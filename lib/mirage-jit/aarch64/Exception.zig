//! Taking an exception and returning from one.
//!
//! Both are here rather than in the translator because both are decisions about
//! where the guest runs next, and a translated block is chosen by the bytes at a
//! program counter it has already seen. Making them traps keeps the vector
//! fetch on the same path as any other instruction fetch, so a vector is
//! translated and executed rather than interpreted.
//!
//! Only the two levels a trimmed `arm64 defconfig` uses are modelled, and only
//! the register bank that matters: there is one set of general registers here,
//! so entering an exception saves the stack pointer for the level being left
//! and loading the one for the level being entered, and there is nothing else
//! to bank. A guest that expects the other levels' banks restored would need
//! real banking, which is what running two levels at once would require.
