//! every value here is a claim about what the translator can do, and a claim
//! that is too generous sends the guest down a path that stops on an instruction
//! this does not model. The rule is to say nothing is implemented unless it is.

//! All of these are read-only and the same for every access. A field that reads
//! zero says "not implemented" for a feature field, except where the architecture
//! numbers the other way, which is noted where it is.
