//! A 16550 UART, enough of one for an x86 guest to print through both the kernel's polled
//! console and the interrupt-driven tty the first process writes to.
//!
//! The kernel's early console polls the line status and writes a byte at a time. The full
//! driver the first process reaches instead writes a byte, enables the transmit interrupt,
//! and waits for it before writing the next. So the transmit holding register carries the
//! bytes, the line status says the transmitter is free, and the port raises an interrupt
//! whenever the transmit interrupt is enabled, because the transmitter is never busy.
