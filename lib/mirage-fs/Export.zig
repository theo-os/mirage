//! Directories on this machine, offered to a guest under one mount.
//!
//! A guest mounts this once and sees a directory holding one name per thing offered. That shape is
//! what lets the set change while the guest runs: the transport cannot add a device to a running
//! machine, so a share added for one piece of work and taken away after it has to be a name in a
//! directory rather than a device of its own. Whoever holds the guest adds and withdraws them, and a
//! guest puts them where it wants them with mounts of its own.
//!
//! This is what a guest mounts. It answers the kernel's filesystem messages from real files here,
//! and it answers every request that would change something with a refusal, so a guest cannot write
//! through it however it asks.
//!
//! What a guest may reach is bounded by name rather than by trust. A name with a separator in it, or
//! one that walks upwards, is refused before anything is opened: the kernel never sends those, so a
//! guest that does is a guest trying to leave, and the answer is that there is no such name. What
//! symlinks point at is the kernel's to resolve inside its own mount, not this end's to follow.
//!
//! Files are reached through `std.Io` rather than through this system's own calls, because the calls
//! differ and the answers do not: one system has `fstatat` and another has `statx`, and a filesystem
//! should not know which. What that costs is that a read waits for the disk on the thread that asked,
//! which is the thread the guest runs on, and a store is on local disk.
