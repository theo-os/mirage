//! A KVM virtual CPU: the shared run structure, the registers, and the exits.
//!
//! KVM decodes a memory access that left the guest and reports it as an MMIO exit,
//! and it services PSCI and WFI inside the kernel. So this backend never produces the
//! `psci` or `wfi` variants of `Backend.Exit`. The Hypervisor.framework backend does,
//! because Apple hands back a raw exception and leaves the decoding to the VMM.
//!
//! `mmio_read.dest` is always zero here. KVM writes the value the device returns back
//! into the guest register itself, from `kvm_run`, so the VMM never names a register.
//! Hypervisor.framework does need the register, which is why the field exists.
